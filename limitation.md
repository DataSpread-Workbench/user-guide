# Limitation

1. Clicking on New in File should be able to create a new dataspread. However, it is not functioning at the moment. Clicking on New will have no effect.

2. Clicking on Open in File should be able to open a existing dataspread. However, it is not functioning at the moment. Clicking on Open will have no effect.

3. Cut in Edit lacks functionality at the moment.

4. After adding a new column, using Undo and Redo will result in unexpected behavior. In other words, the operation of adding a new column cannot be reversed or redone.

5. Formula in Insert has no effect. However, our current system is capable of calculating data by applying formulae. This can be accomplished by directly entering a formula from the Formula Bar.

6. Currently, Text Align in Format can cause our system to crash.

7. The insert link is not functioning properly. Whatever URL is entered, it will always redirect to the current dataspread page.

8. Currently, Sort by column X ascending and Sort by column X descending will cause our system to crash.

10. When there is a large amount of data, derived columns can cause backend crashes.

11. When multiple hosts are present, the page's top right corner should display multiple avatars. However, this feature is not functional currently.
