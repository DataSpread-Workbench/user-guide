# Formatting

Most of the formatting can be modified using the options in the style bar:

First, select the cell you want to style \(or select a range of cells by clicking and dragging\). Then click on which style you want to apply.

Here's a breakdown of each option in the style bar in order \(the first four are not related to formatting cells, but are still useful nonetheless\):

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| Print | Creates a PDF from the current view of the DataSpread and opens it in new tab |
| Zoom | Controls the zoom level of the entire DataSpread \(not just the selected cell\) |
| Font Family | Select which font to use \(i.e. `Arial`, `Roboto`, `Times New Roman`, etc.\) |
| Font Size | Select text size |
| Bold | **Bolds** the text |
| Italics | _Italicizes_ the text |
| Strikethrough | Adds a ~~line through~~ the text |
| Underline | U͟n͟d͟e͟r͟l͟i͟n͟e͟s͟ text |
| Color | Change the text color |
| Cell Color | Change the background color of the cell |
| Center Align | Aligns text to the center of the cell |
| Justify | Adds whitespace to the text to ensure it takes up the full width of the cell |
| Left Align | Aligns text to the left of the cell |
| Right Align | Aligns text to the right of the cell |
| Vertical Align | Can select from `top`, `middle`, `bottom` |
| Hyperlink | Link a cell to an [external website](https://example.com) |
| Wrap | For string data, wraps text such that it goes to the next line instead of overflowing |
